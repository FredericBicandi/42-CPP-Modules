# CPP Module 07 — Templates

## Description
This module introduces C++ templates.  
It teaches how to write generic code that works with any type.

There are 3 exercises:

ex00: generic functions (swap, min, max)  
ex01: template function iter for arrays  
ex02: template class Array

Goal:
Understand how templates allow writing reusable code without rewriting it for each type.

---

## Instructions

Compile inside each exercise folder.

Example:

cd ex00
make
./whatever

cd ex01
make
./iter

cd ex02
make
./array

Compiler flags:
-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98

---

## Library / Classes Description

### ex00 — Templates functions
Functions implemented:
swap  
min  
max  

These functions work with any type:
int, float, string, etc.

Concept learned:
function templates.

---

### ex01 — iter
Template function that:
- takes array address
- takes array size
- takes function pointer
- applies function to each element

Works with:
const arrays  
non-const arrays  

Concept learned:
template with function pointers and const correctness.

---

### ex02 — Array class
Template dynamic array class.

Features:
- dynamic allocation with new[]
- deep copy
- operator[]
- bounds checking (throws exception)
- size() method

Concept learned:
template classes and memory management.

---

## Technical Choices
Templates are defined in header files.
No STL containers used.
Deep copy implemented manually.
Exceptions used for bounds checking.

---

## Resources
C++ reference:
https://en.cppreference.com

Templates:
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/templates

---

## AI Usage
AI was used for:
- clarifying subject requirements
- debugging
- checking template behavior
- verifying edge cases

All implementations were written manually and understood.
