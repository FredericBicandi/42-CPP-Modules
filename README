## Projects Idea

### Module 00

This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specificities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object-Oriented Programming!

### Module 01

This module is designed to help you understand memory allocation, references, pointers to members, and the usage of the switch statement in C++.

### Module 02

This module is designed to help you understand ad-hoc polymorphism, function overloading, and orthodox canonical classes in C++.

### Module 03

    This module is designed to help you understand inheritance in C++.

### Module 04

    This module is designed to help you understand subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces in
    C++.

### Module 05

    This module is designed to help you understand try/catch and exceptions in C++.

### Module 06

    This module is designed to help you understand the different types of casting in C++.

### Module 07

    This module is designed to help you understand templates in C++.

### Module 08

    This module is designed to help you understand templated containers, iterators, and algorithms in C++.

## Guides

The most interesting part of any project is the research that goes behind it. If you are a student, please don't miss out on that opportunity by simply following guides such as these. In any case, they should under no circumstances be your only source of information about this project. Try things, fail, research, try again and succeed! And maybe write your own guide about it. Writing really is the best way to learn.
