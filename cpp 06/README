# CPP Module 06 — C++ Casts

## Description
This project teaches C++ type casting and runtime type identification.

It contains 3 exercises:

ex00: ScalarConverter  
Takes a string literal and converts it to:
char, int, float, double.

ex01: Serialization  
Converts a pointer to an integer and back using reinterpret_cast.

ex02: Identify real type  
Randomly creates A, B, or C objects and detects their real type at runtime using dynamic_cast.

Goal:
Understand C++ casts and when to use each:
static_cast  
reinterpret_cast  
dynamic_cast

---

## Instructions

Compile inside each exercise folder.

Example:

cd ex00
make
./convert 42

cd ex01
make
./serializer

cd ex02
make
./identify

Compiler flags:
-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98

## Classes / Library Description

ScalarConverter
Static utility class.
Detects literal type and prints conversions.
Cannot be instantiated.

Serializer
Static class.
Converts:
Data* → uintptr_t → Data*
Used to understand pointer representation.

Base / A / B / C
Polymorphic classes.
Used to detect real object type at runtime.

Functions:
generate()
identify(Base*)
identify(Base&)

## AI Usage
AI was used for:
- clarifying subject requirements
- debugging
- checking edge cases
- reviewing structure

All implementations were written and understood manually.
